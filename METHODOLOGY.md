# Project Documentation Methodology

## Core Architectural Principles

### Foundational Philosophy
**Architectural Minimalism with Deterministic Reliability**: Every line of code must earn its place through measurable value. Build systems that work predictably in production, not demonstrations of sophistication.

### Code Architecture Principles

**Separation of Concerns (SoC):**
- Each module has single, well-defined responsibility
- Strict modular boundaries with clear interfaces
- Recognize when separation would harm rather than help architecture
- Centralized main entry points with modular project layout

**Deterministic Operations:**
- Synchronous, predictable behavior over async complexity
- Long-runtime stability over cutting-edge patterns
- Production stability over development convenience
- Cross-platform considerations in design decisions

**Performance-Driven Decisions:**
- Choose based on workload requirements, not popular trends
- Apply optimizations only to proven bottlenecks with measurable impact
- Avoid premature optimization that clutters codebase
- Maintain performance baselines and regression detection

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Files never exceed 150 lines (split into separate modules if needed)
- Self-explanatory code without comments
- Preserve readability and maintainability as primary concerns
- KISS and DRY principles expertly applied
- Reuse existing functions before creating new ones

**Error Handling Philosophy:**
- Robust without over-engineering
- Implement what's necessary for production reliability
- Avoid handling every possible edge case
- Graceful failure modes and resource cleanup

**Feature Control:**
- Resist feature bloat and complexity creep
- Every addition must serve core project purpose
- Surgical approach: target exact problem with minimal code
- Multi-language use only when justified by measurable gains

**Web Development Adaptations:**
- No inlining: Styles to separate files, handlers to named functions, configurations as constants
- File size accommodation: Components ≤250 lines (DOM complexity), modules ≤150 lines
- Async operations: API calls, user interactions, data fetching only
- Error boundaries: Network operations, user inputs, third-party integrations
- File colocation: Component.jsx, Component.module.css, Component.test.js
- Component splitting: Multiple purposes or testing difficulty
- Implementation protocol: Request architectural compliance clarification for code generation tasks

## Basic Must-Haves (Phase 0 - Always First)

Every project, regardless of size, must establish these foundational systems before any feature development:

### Benchmarking Suite
- **Core Framework**: Performance measurement with component isolation
- **Regression Detection**: Compare against previous results, fail on performance drops
- **Baseline Management**: Save and track performance baselines over time
- **JSON Output**: Structured data for automated analysis and CI integration
- **Timeline Tracking**: Historical performance data across project evolution

### CI/CD Infrastructure
- **Release Workflows**: Automated versioning, building, and deployment
- **Regression Detection**: Benchmark comparison on every commit/PR
- **Quality Gates**: Block merges that fail performance or quality thresholds
- **Automated Testing**: Run full test suite on code changes

### Core Architecture
- **Centralized Entry Points**: Single main module that orchestrates everything
- **Configuration Management**: Externalized settings with validation
- **Centralized Logging**: Error handling and diagnostic output with JSON integration
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation and testable components

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Suite**: Unit and integration tests for all components
- **Stress Testing**: Load and boundary condition validation
- **Test Data Management**: Reproducible test scenarios and cleanup
- **Coverage Tracking**: Ensure adequate test coverage before releases

### Documentation System
- **Automated Generation**: Extract documentation from code and structure
- **Architecture Documentation**: System design and component relationships
- **API Documentation**: Interface specifications and usage examples
- **Performance Documentation**: Benchmark results and optimization guides

**⚠️ Critical**: These systems must be operational before writing any application logic. They become the foundation that enables rapid, confident development.

## The Documentation Building Process

### Step 1: Project Decomposition

**Ask yourself:**
- What does "finished" look like?
- What are the major pieces that need to exist?
- What depends on what?
- Where are the natural stopping points?

**Create sections based on dependencies:**
```
Major Piece A → Major Piece B → Major Piece C
     ↓              ↓              ↓
  Sub-tasks     Sub-tasks     Sub-tasks
```

### Step 2: Phase Creation

**Phase 0 is mandatory for all projects:**
- Benchmarking suite with regression detection
- GitHub workflows for releases and quality gates
- Test infrastructure (unit + stress testing)
- Documentation generation system
- Centralized architecture setup

**Group remaining work into phases based on:**
- **Dependency chains**: Things that must happen in sequence
- **Logical groupings**: Related functionality that makes sense together
- **Natural checkpoints**: Places where you can validate progress

**Phase Template:**
```
## Phase N: [Descriptive Name] ([Status])

### Purpose: [Why this phase exists - what it enables]

### Dependencies: [What must be complete first]

### Deliverables:
- [ ] [Specific output or component]
- [ ] [Another specific output]

### Completion Criteria:
- [ ] [How you know it's done]
- [ ] [Quality threshold or validation method]

### Architectural Compliance:
- [ ] **SoC VALIDATION**: Each module single responsibility, clear boundaries
- [ ] **FILE SIZE COMPLIANCE**: All files ≤150 lines or properly modularized
- [ ] **DRY ENFORCEMENT**: No duplicate code, existing functions reused
- [ ] **PERFORMANCE INTEGRATION**: Benchmarks operational, gates passing

**PHASE RESULTS:**
- [Component]: [outcome/metric] [status]
- [Component]: [outcome/metric] [status]
```

### Step 3: Task Breakdown

**For each deliverable, define:**
- **Specific action**: What exactly needs to be done
- **Output**: What will exist when complete
- **Success criteria**: How to verify completion
- **Integration points**: How it connects to other work

**Task Template:**
```
### [Component/Output Name]
- [ ] [Action producing specific outcome]
- [ ] [Validation or testing requirement]
- [ ] **[CONNECTION]**: [How this integrates with other components]
- [ ] **[COMPLETE WHEN]**: [Specific, measurable criteria]
- [ ] **[COMPLIANCE CHECK]**: [DRY/KISS/Architecture validation]
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE GATE]**: [Benchmark threshold to meet]
```

### Step 4: Progress Tracking System

**Status Indicators:**
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Done and validated
- 🔒 **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependency
- 📋 **READY**: Dependencies met, can start

**Progress Metrics:**
```
**PHASE STATUS:**
- Component A: [result/metric] ✅
- Component B: [current state] ⚠️
- Overall: [description of current state]
```

### Step 5: Quality Gates

**Define completion criteria that prevent moving forward with incomplete work:**
- Does the output match what was specified?
- Can the next phase actually use this output?
- Is there enough documentation for future reference?
- Are there any obvious issues that need fixing?
